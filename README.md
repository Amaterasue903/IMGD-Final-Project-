# IMGD-Final-Project-

My project consisted of creating a crusher game or the MVP of a crusher game, in my case, utilizing Kaplay and techniques we learned in class. I wanted to make use of not only JavaScript for the first time but also perlin noise within the project itself due to my fascination with randomness and what can be done with it. For me this is my first real time making use of coding to make a game on my own.

## Initial Concept

My initial goal was something more polished and refined, but I soon learned that this was a lot for someone who has barely scratched the surface of JavaScript, and while learning the intricacies of Kaplay on top of taking this step up from what I had made was quite the jump in experience. While my goal was to create something more, I learned what ka play was missing and what I would have to do to get the skeleton of my work going as I progressed. From these impasses, I learned to scale down what I wanted to do, settling on a vertical slice or MVP of the former or initial idea due to time and other work that I had to balance on top of creating this.

## Roadblocks

The largest roadblocks I encountered were vastly different, the first being my first steps of creating the framework of my project, but there were many videos that I was able to research and look through to help decide on how the game itself would be shaped and interacted with in its final project. The largest roadblock on my personal endeavor was implementing Perlin noise. The first part of this being that, unlike P5, Ka play does not possess a dedicated perlin noise function, which made creating the lynch pin of my project a huge mountain of work that I had to learn and implement. Basically creating a number generator that is interpreted and formed to mimic 1D perlin noise, allowing for the creation of the crushers to fit and form within a more natural feeling.

## Feedback

From my small group, I asked to play. The biggest comment I received was that the controls should be listed somewhere, but that was a part of my plan for GitHub

Most of those who played were impressed that I, someone with no coding skills before this, was able to create something, while clunky and not perfectly created, it has much ground to stand on its own.

Of course, there were suggestions to add more and fix the ever-glaring problem of what happens when too many coins spawn for your computer, but for right now, I'm quite happy with where it stands.

## The Game
Feel free to give it a Try!

it uses arrow keys to move and you have to avoid being crushed, try to see how high a score you can get and if your interested in tweeking the numbers of things the code here has easy to change variables.
